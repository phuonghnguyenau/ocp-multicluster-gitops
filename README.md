# OpenShift Multicluster GitOps

This repository contains an implementation of GitOps using Argo CD, Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes (RHACM) and Red Hat Cluster Security for Kubernetes (RHACS). This can be used as a template for adding additional operators and configuration onto OpenShift clusters.

Used my gitops-demo repository as a starting point, but is intended to be a lot more comprehensive.
